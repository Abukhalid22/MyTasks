                Hey there! Welcome to MyTasks.com. This is a simple task
                management app I've put together to showcase various
                integrations and demo my skills in infrastructure development.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
                It's not just about managing tasksâ€”I've designed it to integrate
                with some cool third-party services, making it a great
                playground for testing and demonstrating how different systems
                can work together.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1">
                So, if you're here to check out some integration magic or just
                to see what a solo developer can whip up, you're in the right
                place. Thanks for stopping by and enjoy exploring MyTasks.com!
